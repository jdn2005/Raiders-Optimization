Raider's Optimization is my version of hhpeng's Wynnbuilder.

What does this tool offer that Wynnbuilder does not have? Currently Wynnbuilder has no Aspect or correct Tomes and because of that I have decided to make my own. 
It is in its alpha stage at the moment so do not expect much.

Features it has that Wynnbuilder doesn't:
Effective Raw Spell 

Effective Raw Spell is a way to calculate your total raw damage and raw% damage and sum it up to a cumulative value. It is not an entirely accurate way to determine which build does more damage due to spell damages having different elements. 

Stuff I plan on adding:
Aspects
Warrior tree
Mage tree
Assassin tree
Shaman tree
Major ID
Buffs, Raid Buffs, Trinket Buffs
Tomes
Crafteds
Auto skill point allocation









Raider's Optimization is built in Godot 4.3
